This self-assessment page completes the Reactions & Kinetics module, and covers material from the following sessions.

*   Session 22: [Introduction to Kinetics]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/amorphous-materials/22.-engineering-glass-properties-introduction-to-kinetics) (second half)
*   Session 23: [Reaction Rates]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/reactions-and-kinetics/23-reaction-rates)
*   Session 24: [Diffusion]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/reactions-and-kinetics/24-diffusion)

On this page are a simple **weekly quiz and solutions**; relevant **exam problems and solutions** from the 2009 class; **help session videos** that review selected solutions to the exam problems; and **supplemental exam problems and solutions** for further study.

Weekly Quiz and Solutions
-------------------------

This short quiz is given approximately once for every three lecture sessions. You should work through the quiz problems in preparation for the exam problems.

Exam Problems and Solutions
---------------------------

These exam problems are intended for you to demonstrate your personal mastery of the material, and should be done alone, closed-book, with just a calculator, the two permitted [reference tables]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/syllabus/suggested-textbooks#ref) (periodic table, physical constants), and one 8 1/2" x 11" aid sheet of your own creation.

After you've taken the exam, watch the help session videos below for insights into how to approach some of the exam problems.

Exam Help Session Videos
------------------------

In these videos, 3.091 teaching assistants review some of the exam problems, demonstrating their approach to solutions, and noting some common mistakes made by students.
