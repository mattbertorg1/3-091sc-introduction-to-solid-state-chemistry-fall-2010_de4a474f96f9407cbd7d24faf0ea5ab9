| **Applications** | failure analysis, cooking food at altitude and in pressure cooker, automobile engine cooling, ice skating, artificial diamonds, coffee decaffeination 

### Prerequisites

Before starting this session, you should be familiar with:

*   The Bonding and Molecules module, in particular [Session 12: Intermolecular Forces]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/bonding-and-molecules/12.-intermolecular-forces)

### Looking Ahead

This is the first of three sessions on solid solutions and phase diagrams. Proceed to the next session, [Session 34]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/solid-solutions/34-binary-phase-diagrams-complete-solubility).

### Learning Objectives

After completing this session, you should be able to:

*   Summarize the purpose of a **phase diagram.**
*   Give a detailed interpretation of the **phase diagram of water.**
*   Given a set of material properties data, draw the phase diagram.
*   Given a phase diagram, describe some properties of the material, e.g. the relative densities of its solid and liquid forms.

### Lecture Summary

**Phase stability** is the basis for the solid state of matter. Knowledge of phase stability enables applications like:

*   conducting failure analysis -- recognizing phase "signatures" in the material
*   cooking at altitude -- adapting to different pressure/temperature relationships
*   automobile engine cooling -- exploiting pressure and chemical composition to control the coolant's boiling point (a phase transition temperature)

Prof. Sadoway introduces **phase diagrams** as "stability maps" and "archives of pressure/temperature relationships."

This lecture defines and gives examples of **phase**, **one phase** and **two phase systems, equilibrium, component,** and **triple point**. A detailed discussion of the most familiar one phase system, water, is followed by comparisons of the phase diagrams of aluminum and silicon.

Prof. Sadoway does some live demonstrations for the class:

*   various objects are immersed in liquid nitrogen, going below their **glass transition temperature**
*   properties of liquid oxygen
*   **sublimation** of solid frozen CO2, aka 'dry ice'

The phase diagram of zirconia illustrates the concept of **changing a material's composition** to produce desired behaviors at particular temperature/pressure conditions. The phase diagram of carbon illustrates how artificial diamonds are made. Bisumth and sulfur phase diagrams – "phase diagrams from hell" – have **many regions**. Returning to water, Prof. Sadoway discusses the unusual **phases of ice** at very high pressures and very low temperatures.

As a final application note, the lecture ends with a quick summary of **coffee decaffeination** as a process employing sophisticated manipulation of phase transitions.
