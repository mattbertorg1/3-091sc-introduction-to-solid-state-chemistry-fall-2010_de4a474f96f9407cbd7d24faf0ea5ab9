This self-assessment page completes the Amorphous Materials module, and covers material from the following sessions.

*   Session 21: [Introduction to Glasses]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/amorphous-materials/21-introduction-to-glasses)
*   Session 22: [Engineering Glass Properties]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/amorphous-materials/22.-engineering-glass-properties-introduction-to-kinetics) (first part)

The second part of [Session 22: Introduction to Kinetics]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/amorphous-materials/22.-engineering-glass-properties-introduction-to-kinetics) will be included in the [Self-Assessment]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/reactions-and-kinetics/self-assessment-reactions-and-kinetics) for the next module, Reactions & Kinetics.

On this page are a simple **weekly quiz and solutions**; relevant **exam problems and solutions** from the 2009 class; **help session videos** that review selected solutions to the exam problems; and **supplemental exam problems and solutions** for further study.

Weekly Quiz and Solutions
-------------------------

This short quiz is given approximately once for every three lecture sessions. You should work through the quiz problems in preparation for the exam problems.

Exam Problems and Solutions
---------------------------

These exam problems are intended for you to demonstrate your personal mastery of the material, and should be done alone, closed-book, with just a calculator, the two permitted [reference tables]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/syllabus/suggested-textbooks#ref) (periodic table, physical constants), and one 8 1/2" x 11" aid sheet of your own creation.

*   [Exam solutions key (PDF)]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/amorphous-materials/self-assessment-amorphous-materials/mit3_091scf09_sa5_exam_sol)

After you've taken the exam, watch the help session videos below for insights into how to approach some of the exam problems.

Exam Help Session Videos
------------------------

In this video, a 3.091 teaching assistant reviews an exam problem, demonstrating their approach to the solution, and noting some common mistakes made by students.
