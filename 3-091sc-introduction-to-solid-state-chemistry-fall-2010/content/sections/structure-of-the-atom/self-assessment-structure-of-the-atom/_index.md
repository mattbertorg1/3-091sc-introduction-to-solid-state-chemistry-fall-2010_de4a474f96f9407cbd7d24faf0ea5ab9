This self-assessment page completes the Structure of the Atom module, and covers material from the following sessions.

*   Session 1: [Introduction to Solid State Chemistry]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/structure-of-the-atom/1-introduction-to-solid-state-chemistry)
*   Session 2: [The Periodic Table]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/structure-of-the-atom/2-periodic-table)
*   Session 3: [Atomic Models: Rutherford & Bohr]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/structure-of-the-atom/3-atomic-models)
*   Session 4: [Matter/Energy Interactions: Atomic Spectra, Quantum Numbers]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/structure-of-the-atom/4-matter-energy-interactions)
*   Session 5: [Electron Shell Model & Quantum Numbers]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/structure-of-the-atom/5-electron-shell-model-quantum-numbers)
*   Session 6: [Particle-Wave Duality]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/structure-of-the-atom/6-particle-wave-duality)
*   Session 7: [The Aufbau Principle, Photoelectron Spectroscopy]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/structure-of-the-atom/7.-the-aufbau-principle-photoelectron-spectroscopy)

On this page are a simple **weekly quiz and solutions**; relevant **exam problems and solutions** from the 2009 class; **help session videos** that review selected solutions to the exam problems; and **supplemental exam problems and solutions** for further study.

Weekly Quiz and Solutions
-------------------------

This short quiz is given approximately once for every three lecture sessions. You should work through the quiz problems in preparation for the exam problems.

Exam Problems and Solutions
---------------------------

These exam problems are intended for you to demonstrate your personal mastery of the material, and should be done alone, closed-book, with just a calculator, the two permitted [reference tables]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/syllabus/suggested-textbooks#ref) (periodic table, physical constants), and one 8 1/2" x 11" aid sheet of your own creation.
