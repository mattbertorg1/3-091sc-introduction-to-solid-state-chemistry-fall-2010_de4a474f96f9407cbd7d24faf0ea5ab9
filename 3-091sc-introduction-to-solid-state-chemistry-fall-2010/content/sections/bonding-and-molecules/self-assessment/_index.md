This self-assessment page completes the Bonding and Molecules module, and covers material from the following sessions.

*   Session 8: [Ionic Crystals; Born-Haber Cycle]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/bonding-and-molecules/8.-ionic-crystals-born-haber-cycle)
*   Session 9: [Drawing Lewis Structures]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/bonding-and-molecules/9.-drawing-lewis-structures)
*   Session 10: [Hybridized & Molecular Orbitals; Paramagnetism]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/bonding-and-molecules/10.-hybridized-molecular-orbitals-paramagnetism)
*   Session 11: [The Shapes of Molecules]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/bonding-and-molecules/11.-the-shapes-of-molecules)
*   Session 12: [Intermolecular Forces]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/bonding-and-molecules/12.-intermolecular-forces)

On this page are a simple **weekly quiz and solutions**; relevant **exam problems and solutions** from the 2009 class; **help session videos** that review selected solutions to the exam problems; and **supplemental exam problems and solutions** for further study.

Weekly Quiz and Solutions
-------------------------

This short quiz is given approximately once for every three lecture sessions. You should work through the quiz problems in preparation for the exam problems.

Exam Problems and Solutions
---------------------------

These exam problems are intended for you to demonstrate your personal mastery of the material, and should be done alone, closed-book, with just a calculator, the two permitted [reference tables]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/syllabus/suggested-textbooks#ref) (periodic table, physical constants), and one 8 1/2" x 11" aid sheet of your own creation.
