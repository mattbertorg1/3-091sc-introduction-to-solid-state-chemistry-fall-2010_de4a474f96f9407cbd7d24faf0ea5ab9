### Prerequisites

Before starting this session, you should be familiar with:

*   Basic 3D coordinate geometry and trigonometry, including vectors and planes
*   Photon frequency, wavelength, and energy ([Session 3]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/structure-of-the-atom/3-atomic-models))
*   Atomic absorption and emission of photons ([Session 4]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/structure-of-the-atom/4-matter-energy-interactions))
*   Cubic crystal structures ([Session 15]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/crystalline-materials/15-introduction-to-crystallography))

### Looking Ahead

[Session 17]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/crystalline-materials/17-x-ray-emission-absorption) and [Session 18]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/crystalline-materials/18-x-ray-diffraction-techniques) explain more about the use of x-rays for investigating the structure of crystals and molecules.

### Learning Objectives

After completing this session, you should be able to:

*   Calculate key properties of the **cubic lattices**, such as **atoms per unit cell**, nearest and second-nearest **neighbor distances**, **packing density**, and the relationship between **atomic radius** r and **lattice constant** a.
*   Write the **Miller indices** for any direction, plane, or family of directions or planes, and calculate the **distance** and **angle** between any two directions and/or planes.
*   Given a material and a **crystal direction or plane**, sketch the appropriate **crystal structure** and indicate the correct direction or plane on the sketch.
*   Explain how **x-rays** were produced in 1895, and how Röntgen’s experimental observations lead him to conclude that they were a previously unknown form of **electromagnetic radiation**.
*   Explain how the **properties of x-rays** produce the observed results in the following applications: dental x-rays; quality assurance of welds; airport baggage scans.
*   Relate the energies of the **characteristic emission lines** (Kα, Kβ, etc.) for a given element to the **electron shell structure** of that element.

### Lecture Summary

**Miller indices** are a standard mathematical notation describing **planes** in crystals, derived from where the plane intercepts each coordinate axis. In a specific material with a known **lattice constant** and **crystal structure**, this allows the calculation of angles and distances between planes and directions of interest. For convenience, crystallographers sometimes refer to **families of planes or directions**, which all have the same indices but use different origins.

**X-rays** are well-suited for measuring **atomic-level structure** because their wavelengths are of the same order as typical **lattice constants**. Such short wavelengths require high energies, typically created by sending **high-voltage electrons** into an **anode**, where they **ionize** electrons from the lowest energy levels. Electrons from higher energy levels cascade down to replace them, emitting **photons** with a highly characteristic set of wavelengths, corresponding to the **specific energy levels** of the anode material. The discovery of x-rays by **Wilhelm Röntgen** in 1895 heralded the development of many important modern technologies, including medical radiography, security screening, and industrial inspection of metal parts.
