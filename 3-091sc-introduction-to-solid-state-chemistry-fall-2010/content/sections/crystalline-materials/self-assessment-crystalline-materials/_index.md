This self-assessment page completes the Crystalline Materials module, and covers material from the following sessions.

*   Session 15: [Introduction to Crystallography]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/crystalline-materials/15-introduction-to-crystallography)
*   Session 16: [Crystallographic Notation & X-Rays]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/crystalline-materials/16-crystallographic-notation-x-rays)
*   Session 17: [X-Ray Emission & Absorption]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/crystalline-materials/17-x-ray-emission-absorption)
*   Session 18: [X-Ray Diffraction Techniques]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/crystalline-materials/18-x-ray-diffraction-techniques)
*   Session 19: [Point & Line Defects]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/crystalline-materials/19-point-and-line-defects)
*   Session 20: [Line, Interface, & Bulk Defects]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/crystalline-materials/20-line-interface-and-bulk-defects)

On this page are a simple **weekly quiz and solutions**; relevant **exam problems and solutions** from the 2009 class; **help session videos** that review selected solutions to the exam problems; and **supplemental exam problems and solutions** for further study.

Weekly Quiz and Solutions
-------------------------

This short quiz is given approximately once for every three lecture sessions. You should work through the quiz problems in preparation for the exam problems.

Exam Problems and Solutions
---------------------------

These exam problems are intended for you to demonstrate your personal mastery of the material, and should be done alone, closed-book, with just a calculator, the two permitted [reference tables]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/syllabus/suggested-textbooks#ref) (periodic table, physical constants), and one 8 1/2" x 11" aid sheet of your own creation.
