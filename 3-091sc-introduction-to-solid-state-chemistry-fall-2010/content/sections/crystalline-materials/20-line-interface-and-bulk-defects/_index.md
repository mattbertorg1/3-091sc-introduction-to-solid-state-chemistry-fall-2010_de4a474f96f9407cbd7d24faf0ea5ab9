Session Overview
----------------

| **Module** | Crystalline Materials |
| **Concepts** | defects in crystals: line defects, interfacial defects, grain boundaries, and voids, motion of dislocations, effect of impurities on solid-state material properties |
| **Keywords** | yield stress, strain, shear stress, line defect, surface energy, edge dislocation, screw dislocation, dislocation motion, catalysis, corrosion, grain boundary, annealing, vacancy, single-crystal, polycrystalline, precipitation strengthening, ductility, slip, voids, solution hardening, elastic deformation, plastic deformation, chemical metallurgy, physical metallurgy, Hooke’s law, fracture, close-packed, dislocation glide, toughness, hardness, brittle |
| **Chemical Substances** | steel, aluminum-copper alloy (Al-Cu), silica (SiO2), calcia (CaO), alumina (Al2O3) |
| **Applications** | aluminum can, steel production, aluminum-copper for airplanes, rivets on the Titanic 

### Prerequisites

Before starting this session, you should be familiar with:

*   Cubic crystal structures ([Session 15]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/crystalline-materials/15-introduction-to-crystallography))
*   Crystal directions, planes, and Miller indices ([Session 16]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/crystalline-materials/16-crystallographic-notation-x-rays))
*   Structure of edge dislocations ([Session 19]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/crystalline-materials/19-point-and-line-defects))

### Looking Ahead

The amount and composition of precipitates in alloys can be predicted using binary phase diagrams, as described in [Session 34]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/solid-solutions/34-binary-phase-diagrams-complete-solubility) and [Session 35]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/solid-solutions/35-binary-phase-diagrams-limited-solubility). Point defects and grain boundaries give atoms space to move through the lattice, a key factor in [Session 24: Diffusion]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/reactions-and-kinetics/24-diffusion).

### Learning Objectives

After completing this session, you should be able to:

*   Given a crystal under stress, determine the **slip planes**.
*   Sketch the **movement of dislocations** through the lattice, and explain how this motion contributes to **plastic deformation** and **work hardening**.
*   Given a specific material, consider its **processing history** and application, and identify what **defects** are likely to be present and how they affect the **properties** of interest.

### Lecture Summary

Experimental values for the **yield strengths** of metals are roughly 1/10th those given by theoretical calculations based on breaking entire planes of atomic bonds. The discrepancy is explained by **dislocations**, introduced at the end of the last session, which allows **slipping planes** to break single bonds in sequence, lowering the **yield stress**. Two-dimensional defects can occur at the surface of crystals or at internal interfaces between zones with different lattice alignments, called **grain boundaries**. Macroscopic clusters of vacancies (**voids**) weaken metals, while clusters of impurities (**precipitates**) may weaken or strengthen them. The failure of rivets on the hull of the _Titanic_ is attributed to brittle pockets of slag mixed into the steel, based on examination of the **microstructure**.
