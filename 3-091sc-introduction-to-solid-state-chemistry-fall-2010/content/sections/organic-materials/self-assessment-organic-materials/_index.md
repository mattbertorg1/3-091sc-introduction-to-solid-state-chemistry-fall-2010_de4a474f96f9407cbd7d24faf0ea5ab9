This self-assessment page completes the Organic Materials module, and covers material from the following sessions.

*   Session 27: [Introduction to Organic Chemistry]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/organic-materials/27-introduction-to-organic-chemistry)
*   Session 28: [Polymers: Structure & Composition]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/organic-materials/28-polymers-structure-composition)
*   Session 29: [Polymers: Synthesis, Properties & Applications]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/organic-materials/29-polymers-synthesis-properties-applications)
*   Session 30: [Biochemistry: Amino Acids]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/organic-materials/30-amino-acids)
*   Session 31: [Biochemistry: Protein Structure]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/organic-materials/31-protein-structure)
*   Session 32: [Biochemistry: Lipids, Nucleic Acids & DNA]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/organic-materials/32-lipids-nucleic-acids-dna)

On this page are two **weekly quizzes and solutions**; relevant **exam problems and solutions** from the 2009 class; **help session videos** that review selected solutions to the exam problems; and **supplemental exam problems and solutions** for further study.

Weekly Quiz and Solutions
-------------------------

These short quizzes are given approximately once for every three lecture sessions. You should work through the quiz problems in preparation for the exam problems.

Exam Problems and Solutions
---------------------------

These exam problems are intended for you to demonstrate your personal mastery of the material, and should be done alone, closed-book, with just a calculator, the two permitted [reference tables]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/syllabus/suggested-textbooks#ref) (periodic table, physical constants), and one 8 1/2" x 11" aid sheet of your own creation.

After you've taken the exam, watch the help session videos below for insights into how to approach some of the exam problems.

Exam Help Session Videos
------------------------

In these videos, 3.091 teaching assistants review some of the exam problems, demonstrating their approach to solutions, and noting some common mistakes made by students.
